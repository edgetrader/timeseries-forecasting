# Time Series Forecasting of half-hourly electricity system demand in Singapore

Time series provide the opportunity to forecast future values. In this analysis, using time series data from Energy Authority of Singapore, we attempt to forecast electricity system demand for every half hour period (MW) in Singapore.

One of the methods available in Python to model and predict future points of a time series is known as SARIMAX, which stands for Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Averages with eXogenous regressors. Here, we will primarily focus first on ARIMA and then SARIMA, which is used to fit time-series data to better understand and forecast future points in the time series.
